This is my hammerspoon config file for my work computer. To install, drop the `init.lua` into your `~/.hammerspoon` directory and reload your config.

If you don't know what [hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) is you should definitely [check it out](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon). Essentially, it allows you to automate OSX using a language called [Lua](http://www.lua.org/).
